If you see the depth of this project. We have done a huge work on finding the datasets and uploading them into the model and training the model to act accordingly.
As seen above this project has been done using certain packages (pip) and tools.
Thanks to TensorFLow from Google. Our model was trained using these tools.
If in case you find our page in GitHub. You'll find a separate file named (Steps to work with), where you can find the steps on how to download and install all the files and make them work on your pc or mac. 
I hope you like it and FingerCrossed our mini project helps your studies or team work in the future.
Thank you and I hope we can commit more by finding interesting projects and work on it. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY :)
